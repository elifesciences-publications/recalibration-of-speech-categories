This projects is the companion code for the manuscript:  
"Integrating prediction errors at two time scales permits rapid recalibration of speech sound categories"
by Itsaso Olasagasti and Anne-Lise Giraud, University of Geneva.

It includes the files used to simulate a speech recalibration experiment.

It contains the following files:
- README
- **run_simulations_multiple_parameters.m**: The main MATLAB script. Calls the file 
  'run_experiment_100_participants.m' for each model. 
- **run_experiment_100_participants.m**: For each model the script simulates 
  the experiment on 100 participants.
- **experimental_stimuli.mat**: the file containing the 100 experimental paradigms.
